# Image Processing
A compilation of Image Processing programs that I've worked on.

## Motivation
This entire repository has been built on the documentation provided, and the guidance offered by Professor Sibi Chakkaravarthy, from the years I've studied in the university, Vellore Institute of Technology AP, and he has guided me through the learning process of Image Processing, and it's use cases.

This repository was made to self-evaluate and debug errors in the programs, since there are significant issues with changing programs from Python 2 to Python 3

## Chapter 1

This section of the programs essentially teaches you the basic concepts of computer vision and the usage of opencv, and cv2.
Through the code's execution, you learn essential aspects such as,
```
- Loading and writing images to disks
- Manipulating pixels to change images
- Drawing using OpenCV and Numpy
- Basic operations on images - translation, rotation, resizing, flipping, and cropping
- Arithmatic operations performed on images
- Bitwise operations using Numpy and OpenCV
- Masking images to retrieve certain aspects of the image
- Splitting and merging color channels present in an image
- Utilizing kernels in order to perform morphological operations on images
- Smoothing and blurring images through different methods
- Working with color and colorspaces
- Thresholding images using different methods
- Gradient orientation and Sobel kernels
- Edge detection and Contour identification
- Contour properties
- Case Studies - Tic Tac Toe, and Tetris
- Contour Approximation and Sorting Contours
- Histogram Masks and Histogram Equalization
- Connected Component Labelling
