# Image Processing
A compilation of Image Processing programs that I've worked on.

## Motivation
This entire repository has been built on the documentation provided, and the guidance offered by Professor Sibi Chakkaravarthy, from the years I've studied in the university, Vellore Institute of Technology AP, and he has guided me through the learning process of Image Processing, and it's use cases.

Chapter 6 : Case Studies

## Chapter 1
This section of the programs essentially teaches you the basic concepts of computer vision and the usage of opencv, and cv2.
Through the code's execution, you learn essential aspects such as,
```
Loading and writing images to disks
Manipulating pixels to change images
Drawing using OpenCV and Numpy
Basic operations on images - translation, rotation, resizing, flipping, and cropping
Arithmatic operations performed on images
Bitwise operations using Numpy and OpenCV
Masking images to retrieve certain aspects of the image
Splitting and merging color channels present in an image
Utilizing kernels in order to perform morphological operations on images
Smoothing and blurring images through different methods
Working with color and colorspaces
Thresholding images using different methods
Gradient orientation and Sobel kernels
Edge detection and Contour identification
Contour properties
```
