A compilation of Image Processing programs that I've worked on.

The sections covered in these programs are,
<ul>
<li>Reading Images and utilising argparse to input images into the program
<li>Using Numpy and OpenCV to mask images and extract features from it
<li>Morphing Images in order to abstract it's features
